Our lab seeks to improve understanding of environmental fluid mechanics through using novel data and measurement techniques in the field. We are a part of the Physics of Oceans and Atmospheres (POA) discipline group in the College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS) at the Oregon State University. Topics of interest include air/sea interactions, turbulence, waves, boundary layers,  near-shore processes, and sea ice.
