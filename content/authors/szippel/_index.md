Seth Zippel is an Assistant Professor at Oregon State University in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS). Seth studies how the ocean and the atmosphere interact using field measurements from a diverse set of regions including estuaries, the open ocean, and the Arctic. Air-sea interactions are heavily influenced by waves, wave breaking, and turbulent processes in the upper ocean, and these processes ultimately are important for prediction of weather, climate, and sea state. When Seth is not in the lab, he enjoys hiking, biking, surfing, and rowing.
