Seth Zippel is an Assistant Scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering department. Seth studies how the ocean and the atmosphere interact using field measurements from a diverse set of regions including estuaries, the open ocean, and the Arctic. Air-sea interactions are heavily influenced by waves, wave breaking, and turbulent processes in the upper ocean, and these processes ultimately are important for prediction of weather, climate, and sea state. When Seth is not in the lab, he is out surfing or learning to kiteboard in Cape Cod's Waquoit Bay.
