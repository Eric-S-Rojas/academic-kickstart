title: "Air/Sea Fluxes Mediated by Pressure Work"
summary: "I am funded by NSF to investigate the wave-modulated transfer of energy between the atmosphere and the ocean by making measurements of the mean, wave-driven and turbulent motions on both sides of the air-sea interface. Field work anticipated for Fall 2021, and 2022"

Drs. Seth Zippel, Malcolm Scully, and  Jim Edson are seeking a doctoral student for an NSF-funded project to study turbulence in the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers. We are hoping to understand the role of ocean waves, wave breaking, and turbulent pressure in atmosphere and ocean exchanges, which are central to understanding air/sea transfer of heat, gasses, and momentum. We will conduct two field experiments with a tower in Pamlico sound, NC, collecting wave, turbulence, and pressure data on both the atmosphere and water sides of the boundary. These findings will help improve our fundamental understanding of air/sea interactions, which are central to weather, climate, and upper ocean transport for biota, plastics, and other tracers.
